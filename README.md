# AlpineEditor

The AlpineEditor is a simple WYSIWYG HTML Editor, with the use in Alpine.JS and Livewire in mind.
It is based on [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) which is a solid foundation for any kind of Editor.

## Why another WYSIWYG Editor?

Well, there are many Editors out there, including CKEditor, TinyMCE, Trix etc. but they miss all the spirit of Alpine.JS!  

While all the previously mentioned Editors are great, for me they provide way too much "boilerplate".  
For CK and Tiny you need to create Themes when you want to customize them etc. 

What I wanted is to be more "declarative". With AlpineEditor you simply define two `div`s, one for the Editor itself and one for the Menu. In the Menu `div` you simply add Buttons with a `data-command` attribute, which defines what the Button should do, clicked. You have kind of full control over the markup and style it with ease (e.g. with TailwindCSS) without having to think about more or less complex CSS provided by the Editor to override.

You can even use Alpine.JS (or JS in general) to create Dropdown or something within the Toolbar.

## How does it work?

First of all include the AlpineEditor via CDN:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/maxeckel/alpine-editor@0.2.0/dist/alpine-editor.min.js"></script>
```

When this is done you can use Alpine.JS to initialize an Editor instance:

```html
<div 
    x-data="{
        editorConfig: { 
            editorClasses: 'focus:outline-none',
            content: 'Dummy',
        }
    }" 
    x-init="
        new AlpineEditor($refs.editor, $refs.editorMenu, editorConfig);
    " 
    class="bg-gray-200 border border-gray-900"
>
    <div x-ref="editorMenu" class="relative z-0 inline-flex shadow-sm rounded-md">
        <button 
            type="button" 
            data-command="strong" 
            data-active-class="bg-blue-400" 
            class="bg-gray-500"
        >
            Bold
        </button>
        <button 
            type="button" 
            data-command="em" 
            data-active-class="bg-blue-400" 
            class="bg-gray-500"
        >
            Emphasize
        </button>
        <button 
            type="button" 
            data-command="code" 
            data-active-class="bg-blue-400" 
            class="bg-gray-500"
        >
            Code
        </button>
        <button 
            type="button" 
            data-command="heading" 
            data-level="1"
            data-active-class="bg-blue-400" 
            class="bg-gray-500"
        >
            H1
        </button>
    </div>

    <div x-ref="editor" class="p-2">
    </div>
</div>
```

In this exmaple, we simply create an Editor instance within x-init and pass it 3 Params:

- $refs.editor: This is a simple x-ref to the Editors wrapper, in which it will initialize itself.
- $refs.menu: This is a simple x-ref to the Editors Menu wrapper, all Button within this wrapper (defining `data-command`) will be initialized with their respective action.
- editorConfig: This is a simple Object, containing classes which should be applied to the Editor Markup and the content of the Editor. This is synced when the Editor state changes, so you could use @entangle when using Livewire. 

With this you are good to go! You have an (unstyled) Editor which "Bold", "Emphasize" and "Code" actions.
